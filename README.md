# Drug Discovery using Python

In this repository I collect a bunch of interesting little projects that could be part of a drug discovery process.
The projects include:
  1. ChemBLMining: A Python program, that uses the API's from ChemBL and Uniprot to discover known drugs and their targets
  2. Factor Analysis: A jupyter notebook containing a brief introduction to factor analysis 

## ChemBLMining

Please use your favourite programming language (shell scripts, python, R, for
instance) and APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) of databases to perform
following operations. Submit your code.
1. Retrieve all approved drugs from the ChEMBL database, sort them by approval
year and name (a Python example is here; documentations of the ChEMBL API
can be found here);

2. For each approved drug since 2012 that you identified in step (1), retrieve a list
of UniProt accession numbers, namely protein targets associated with the drug;

3. For each protein with a UniProt accession number that you identified in step (2),
retrieve UniProt keywords associated with it. You can use the UniProt API,
documented here. Python and R clients are also available.
